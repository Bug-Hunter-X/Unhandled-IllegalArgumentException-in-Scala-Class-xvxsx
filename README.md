# Unhandled Exception in Scala Class

This repository demonstrates a common error in Scala programming: failing to handle exceptions properly.

The `MyClass.scala` file contains a class with a setter method that throws an `IllegalArgumentException` under certain conditions.  The `Main` object demonstrates how this exception, if unhandled, can lead to program crashes.  The solution file shows how to effectively catch and handle the exception.

This example highlights the importance of robust exception handling for creating reliable Scala applications.
